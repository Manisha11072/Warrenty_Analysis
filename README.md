**Warranty Claims Analysis for Peterbilt Motor Company**

**Project Overview**

This project focuses on analyzing warranty claims data for Peterbilt Motor Company to identify attributes or attribute combinations that lead to increased warranty costs. Through data-driven insights, the project aims to reduce warranty expenses, enhance product reliability, and support informed decisions for future vehicle configurations.


**Problem Statement**

Peterbiltâ€™s highly customizable heavy-duty vehicles introduce complexity and potential warranty risks. The project seeks to identify high-cost attributes and attribute interactions that elevate warranty claims, helping the company optimize configurations to balance customer satisfaction with cost efficiency.


**Objectives**


**Identify High-Cost Attributes:** Determine attributes strongly associated with increased warranty claims.

**Attribute Pair Analysis:** Investigate specific attribute combinations that may increase warranty costs.

**Predictive Modeling:** Develop models to predict the likelihood of warranty claims, supporting optimized vehicle configurations.



**Data and Solution**


**Data:** The project utilizes two datasets: vehicle attributes with option codes and associated warranty claims data.

**Solution:** The analysis includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and predictive modeling. Visualizations and models offer insights into high-risk configurations and allow for targeted recommendations.


**Key Recommendations**


**Purposeful Innovation:** Redesign high-risk components and enhance quality checks.

**Individualized Solutions:** Use predictive insights to provide customer-specific configurations and proactive maintenance plans.

**Enduring Craftsmanship:** Avoid high-risk attribute combinations and refine assembly processes.

**Pride and Class:** Promote reliable configurations as premium options to build brand loyalty.

**Cost Efficiency:** Optimize inventory and resource allocation based on reliability data.





**Expected Results**


1.Identify attributes associated with higher warranty claims.

2.Develop a predictive model to forecast warranty claim likelihood for specific configurations.

3.Drive cost savings and improved customer satisfaction through data-informed decisions.

4.By implementing these insights, Peterbilt can reduce warranty costs, improve product reliability, and strengthen its brand reputation through strategic, data-driven decisions.
